\intro{
    Your task is to train a deep neural network for the CIFAR-10 dataset, to reach an accuracy that is as high as 
    possible. You must implement at least two different architectures of neural networks: a fully connected neural 
    network and a convolutional neural network. For both architectures, you try to find the best network 
    configuration and training settings. Finally, you compare the two models regarding accuracy and 
    computational effort and recommend a final architecture to use for this task.

    A summary of the final comparison of your models, containing the exact architectures of your fully 
    connected and convolutional models (number and types of layers, size of the layers, training 
    settings), as well as a reasoning, why the recommended model was selected (including the 
    corresponding numbers). The summary must be in the form of 3-5 slides in PDF format.
